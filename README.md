# Unsupervised Learning Techniques for Music Collection Segmentation
For this project I analyzed my DJ music collection of around 2700 tracks and clustered songs together based on existing attributes (e.g. tempo, musical key, and runtime) as well as additional attributes (such as instrumentalness, Danceability, and Energy) gathered from Spotify's API.

Clustering was completed using a combination of statistical methods, K-Means and K-Medoids clustering algorithms, and Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction. The resulting track groupings provided a novel approach to setlist creation other than simply organizing tracks by genre. I was able to use these new track groupings to create fun mixes and live performances. Further details of the project can be found in the attached paper as well as the Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code.
